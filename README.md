<br>
In computer science, recursion is described as a function or method that calls itself. It often involves a series of numbers or a linked list, and requires a terminal condition. Common examples of recursive algorithms can be found when calculating factorials or exponents, or when traversing a tree structure.

<h1>Minimum Requirements</h1>

Write a command line program (in Windows) to find names of files and directories that match a specified pattern.

<ol>

 <li>The program must be called walker.exe.</li>

 <li>The program must take two command line arguments – one for the starting directory, and the other as a regular expression describing the pattern that must be matched by the name of the directory or file.</li>

 <li>The output of the program should display all the directory and file names that match the search expression.

  <ol>

   <li>If there is nothing that matched, you should state, “No file or directory found.”</li>

   <li>For each directory found, display the full directory path, each on a separate line.</li>

   <li>For each file found, display the full file path, each on a separate line.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>To walk the directory structure, a recursive algorithm must be used.</li>

</ol>
